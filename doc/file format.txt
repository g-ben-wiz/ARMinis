one vertex per line
the cell centers are assigned in Terrain::load_data(char* filename)
x center: average of x tile boundaries
z center: average of z tile boundaries
y "center": highest y in the tile

The tiles are arranged so that all columns are read first, then the next entire row.
First four vertices in the input file are tile 0, 0
Next four are tile 0, 1
Next n are up to tile 0, n
Next four are tile 1, 0
Until tile m, n

The sample file is 50 x 50 x 1 tiles and all files should be that way (small scopers)
